# <a name="introduction">Introduction</a>
In this project I use HTML and CSS to create a dashboard showing off the analysis I've done <a href="https://github.com/saif-gorges/Python-APIs-Challenge">here</a>.

# <a name="lat">Latitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard</a>
I have created individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. 
I have also created a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.


## <a name="breakdown">Website Breakdown</a>
- A landing page containing which will contain:
  - An explanation of the project.
  - Links to each visualizations page. There will be a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image will take the user to that visualization.

- Four visualization pages, each with:
  - A descriptive title and heading tag.
  - The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
  - A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.

- A "Comparisons" page that:
  - Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
  - Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations.

- A "Data" page that:
  - Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
